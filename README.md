Nest JS build on top of node js

http server alway use express JS

typescript + express very essential for us to build the backend

important thing about Nest JS ->Modules( more like a folder structure)

Nest JS teach us how to writing the code , and put each important part in each folder( very useful)

Middleware little bit exception

E filters a little bit

pipes not so much

Guard only when we need authoziation( depend on project need it or not)

GraphQL not gonna use on this project

CLI maybe use

Recipes : there's a CRUD generator it simple and original, Node JS doesn't have this doesn't provide

we can generate a lot of files "Nest-g- resource is gonna build everthing for us"

Database very important (need to use TYPEORM)
