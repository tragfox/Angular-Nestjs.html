<h1>Nest JS build on top of node js

    http server alway use express JS
    
    typescript + express very essential for us to build the backend
    
    important thing about Nest JS ->Modules( more like a folder structure)
    
    Nest JS teach us how to writing the code , and put each important part in each folder( very useful)
    
    Middleware little bit exception
    
    E filters a little bit
    
    pipes not so much
    
    Guard only when we need authoziation( depend on project need it or not)
    
    GraphQL not gonna use on this project
    
    CLI maybe use
    
    Recipes : there's a CRUD generator it simple and original, Node JS doesn't have this doesn't provide
    
    we can generate a lot of files "Nest-g- resource is gonna build everthing for us"
    
    Database very important (need to use TYPEORM)</h1>
