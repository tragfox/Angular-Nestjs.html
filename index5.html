        11.1 nestJS folder structure &how each file works
        
        module system :
        
        "async function" its a coding keyword
        
        "bootstrap()" it mean its to change the name
        
        "function" is how we gonna write  the codes
        
        "const  app"mean we gonna name a new variable
        
        "@nestjs/core" this is officaly package nest JS framework provied for us
        
        "nest factory" get it out from here and used right here that why we import from nestJS
        
        "app.module" we get it out from file.slash
        
        (app controller , app service, app module) coming from another file  "ts."
        
        notice is there line doesnt have nestjs then they are not from officaly package
        
        "export" is mandatory key word you can not change it
